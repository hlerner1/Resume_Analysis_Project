# Resume Analysis Project

This project was primarily worked on in google colab, but also some amount in jupyter notebooks. The two models as well as the randomly generated embeddings were produced in the colab file which has the name "585-project-code". If you are to open that file you will be greeted with a command to mount to a google drive. If you wish to use google drive to analyze this data, change the filepath to the drive you wish to work in. To set this up on your own, you will need to change the file paths at:
- The ls check of file path
- mypath
  - same path as the ls file path
- glove_file
  - the file path to a 50-dimensional glove embedding file
- the temp variable
  - to gather the labeled data
